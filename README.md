# Cat-Clicker

## Overview

This is an app that displays cats pictures, related names, info and numbers of clicks made on each of them.

While its scope and functionality may appear trivial, it is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree with the purpose of raising the awareness of the developer regarding code repetition, "spaghetti code", smart coding and reusable coding techniques. It also helps to see how a real dev project takes place as the expectations from the Udacity trainers are continuously changing, encouraging the developer to make a smart and scalable app.

## How to run the tool ?

Simply open the page https://alffox.github.io/cat-clicker/, then click on your favorite cat picture on the left sidebar, all information will be displayed in the dashboard below the big picture.

Clicks will increase, however, they won't persist upon refreshing the page.

## Project Specs

### Visuals
The application should display:

 - a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
 - an area to display the
   selected cat

In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:

 - the cat's name
 - a picture of the cat
 - text showing the number of clicks

The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction
When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
