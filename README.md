# Cat-Clicker

## Overview

This is an app that displays cats pictures, related names and numbers of clicks made on each of them.

While its scope and functionality may appear trivial, it is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree ([JavaScript Design Patterns course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989))

The goals of this app are raising the awareness of the developer regarding code repetition, how to avoid spaghetti code, follow smart and scalable coding with reusable coding techniques.

## How to run the tool ?

Simply open the page https://alffox.github.io/cat-clicker/, then click on any cat name in the list to know more info. Upon click, the cat's info and picture will be displayed.

## Technical notes

The app was created following the MOV (Model - Octopus - View) pattern, see more info @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns

You may notice minimal styling in the app: that's on purpose as the actual focus, in this project, is on the JS part.
